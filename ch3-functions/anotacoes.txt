"A return keyword without an expression after it will cause the function to return undefined.
Functions that donâ€™t have a return statement at all, such as makeNoise , similarly return
undefined."


console.log("The future says:", future());
function future() {
return "You'll never have flying cars";
}
The preceding code works, even though the function is defined below the code
that uses it. Function declarations are not part of the regular top-to-bottom
flow of control. They are conceptually moved to the top of their scope and can
be used by all the code in that scope.

This is sometimes useful because it offers
the freedom to order code in a way that seems meaningful, without worrying
about having to define all functions before they are used.
